In this project, I learned how to handle a database using a table I made in mysql workbench.
I created a node application that read from the mysql database and displayed the necessary elements in the application.
The application handles as a store where the user picks an item to buy and how many they want to buy using the inquiry package.
It then calculates the total cost of how much you are buying and displays it to the user.
It also updates the stock quantity of the item bought.
If the user tries to buy more than the stock quantity, they are told that there is not enough to fulfill their request.
